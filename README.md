# Product Catalog Web Application
This is a .NET Core (MVC) web application for managing a product catalog. The application allows users to view, add, edit, and delete products. Additionally, products can be filtered by category, and there is a details view for each product.

## Technologies Used
* .NET Core (MVC): The application is built using the .NET Core framework with the Model-View-Controller architecture.
* Entity Framework (EF): EF is used for working with the MSSQL database, including data access and migrations.
* Identity: ASP.NET Identity is utilized for user management and to enable admin privileges.
* AutoMapper: AutoMapper is used for object-to-object mapping, making it easier to work with data transfer objects (DTOs).
